<h1>Purpose</h1>
 This is a mini-project I worked on to populate my rainmeter skin's quote file ~~and feed my need to hoard loads of data~~. There were originally only like 10 lines in the file, so I thought "why not give them more?" It was also a good excuse for me to figure out how `node.js` and webscraping works.
 
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
 You're going to need [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) if you're going to attempt to run this code. Node.js doesn't inherently support the `document` object, so we'll have to use JSDOM as a surrogate.
 
<h2>How do I use this for myself?</h2>
 Great question! Just clone the repository into some folder and run Scraper.js! You should get your results relatively quick, provided you have the dependencies listed above, and the website is still up.
